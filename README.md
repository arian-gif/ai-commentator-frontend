## 🚀 How It Works

1. User uploads a short sports video clip (.mp4)
2. The frontend sends the video to the backend (see link below)
3. The backend uses Whisper (for audio), Gemini (for text generation), and optionally CV (for silent videos)
4. The generated commentary is displayed in a polished UI card
